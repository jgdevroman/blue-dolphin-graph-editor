**React Compiler — skipped.** The compiler is designed for codebases that haven't manually applied `memo`/`useCallback`. This project does the opposite: explicit `React.memo` and stable callbacks are a deliberate architecture choice that demonstrates the optimization reasoning. Enabling the compiler on top would make that reasoning invisible.

## CI

A GitHub Actions workflow runs on every push to `main` and on every push to a pull request targeting `main`. The pipeline must pass before merging:

1. **Install** — `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
2. **Lint** — `biome check .` (formatting + lint rules)
3. **Build** — `tsc -b && vite build` (type check + bundle)

To enforce this as a merge gate, enable branch protection on `main` in GitHub Settings and require the `check` status to pass.

## Architecture

## Key Decisions

### Efficient list rendering: `React.memo` + `content-visibility`, not custom windowing

The spec says "efficient rendering (no external virtualization libraries)." That rules out `react-window` and friends, but it doesn't require us to write our own. The interesting question is: what's the actual bottleneck at 1000 items, and where does it live?

**The actual bottleneck is React reconciliation, not browser scroll.** Every time the `nodes` array changes (selection sync from canvas, adding a node, editing a name), React walks the entire list to diff. Without intervention that's a ~30-80 ms pause per interaction. Browser paint of 1000 small `<li>` elements is comparatively cheap.

So the design solves the problem at the layer it lives:

- **React layer**: `React.memo` on the row component so unchanged rows skip reconciliation entirely. Stable callbacks (`useCallback`) so prop equality holds. Row props are primitives only (`id`, `name`, `isSelected`) — never the full `nodes` array.
- **Browser layer**: `content-visibility: auto; contain-intrinsic-size: 0 48px` on each row so the browser skips paint and layout for off-screen items. ~93% global support as of 2026.

**Approaches considered:**

### Responsive side panel: persistent drawer, not temporary

The side panel uses MUI's persistent drawer variant on small screens rather than temporary (modal). A temporary drawer overlays the canvas; a persistent one slides in and the canvas adjusts alongside it. This keeps the canvas visible and avoids the overlay pattern that makes the two areas feel unrelated.

**Breakpoint behavior:**

| Screen | Drawer variant | Panel width | Canvas |
|--------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| `xs` (< 600 px) | Persistent | `100vw` — full screen | Hidden behind panel when open |
| `sm` – `md` (600 – 900 px) | Persistent | 320 px fixed | Remains visible |
| `md`+ (> 900 px) | Permanent | 320 px fixed | Always alongside panel |

The toggle button is hidden while the drawer is closing and only reappears once the exit transition finishes (`slotProps.transition.onExited`), avoiding a jarring overlap between the button and the sliding panel.

The panel is wrapped in `<aside>` rather than being placed inside `<main>`. It is supplementary to the canvas (not primary content), which matches the semantic intent of `<aside>`. The canvas itself lives in `<main>`.

### DiagramWrapper pattern: initialization separate from UI logic

`DiagramWrapper` follows the same component split used in the official `gojs-react-basic` example. The wrapper owns everything that only needs to run once: `initDiagram` (the GoJS diagram factory) and the `ChangedSelection` listener setup, both in effects with `[]` deps. `DiagramCanvas` sits above it and owns the React state and business logic, accessing the diagram instance through the `diagramRef` prop it passes down. This keeps GoJS initialization concerns out of the stateful layer and makes both components easier to reason about in isolation.

### Canvas-driven node and link creation: GoJS built-in tools, synced via `onModelChange`

Node and link creation is handled entirely by GoJS built-in tools, not by React event handlers:

- **Node creation** — `clickCreatingTool.archetypeNodeData` stamps a node into the GoJS model on background double-click. No custom event listener is needed.
- **Link creation** — the `LinkingTool` activates automatically when the user drags from a node's border. This requires `portId: ""` on the shape; without it, GoJS does not recognize the shape as a port and the tool never starts.

GoJS fires `onModelChange` (via `go.IncrementalData`) after every model transaction. `DiagramCanvas.handleModelChange` reads `insertedNodeKeys` / `insertedLinkKeys` and the accompanying `modifiedNodeData` / `modifiedLinkData` to sync new items into React state. `setSkipsDiagramUpdate(true)` is set immediately after so ReactDiagram does not push the same data back into GoJS on the following re-render.

The `onModelChange` also fires during the initial model load when ReactDiagram first seeds GoJS with the `nodeDataArray` prop. Without a guard this would double-add all seed nodes. The fix is an existence check in the updater: if the id is already in `prev`, return `prev` unchanged.

### Undirected graph enforcement: `linkValidation` on the `LinkingTool`

`diagram.toolManager.linkingTool.linkValidation` is set to a function that calls `fromNode.findLinksBetween(toNode)`. This method counts links in both directions, so attempting to draw B→A when A→B already exists is rejected. Self-links (same node as source and target) are also rejected in the same check. This keeps the graph undirected without needing to inspect link direction at all.

### Selection sync: scroll-to-node in list and canvas jump

Selecting a node from either the side panel list or the canvas keeps the other surface in sync. Two separate behaviors are involved: scrolling the list row into view, and panning the canvas to center on the node.

**List scroll on selection**

`NodeList` holds a `ref` on the MUI `<List>` element and a `useEffect` on `selectedId`. When `selectedId` changes the effect queries `[data-node-id="${selectedId}"]` inside the list and calls `scrollIntoView({ block: "center" })`. The `data-node-id` attribute is set on each `NodeRow`'s `<ListItem>`.

The scroll is suppressed when the selection originated from the list itself (clicking a row). A `selectedFromList` state flag is set in the row's `onClick` and checked at the top of the effect. Using state rather than a ref here means the flag read is correctly captured in the effect closure; the flag is reset on every effect run regardless of path.

**Canvas pan on panel selection**

`DiagramCanvas` calls `diagram.centerRect(node.actualBounds)` inside the `selectedId` effect when syncing React state into GoJS. This is only reached when `skipsDiagramUpdate` is `false`, meaning the selection was driven from React (the panel), not from a canvas click. Canvas-click selections set `skipsDiagramUpdate = true` in `handleChangedSelection`, which causes the effect to return early before reaching `centerRect`.

**Two-ref guard architecture**

The two-way sync between React and GoJS requires two separate guards. They serve opposite directions and have different timing constraints:

| Guard | Type | Set by | Read by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `skipsDiagramUpdate` | state | `handleChangedSelection`, `handleModelChange` | selection sync effect | Prevents `centerRect` from running when GoJS drove the selection. Also passed as prop to `ReactDiagram` to prevent it from re-applying `nodeDataArray` back into GoJS after model mutations. |
| `suppressNextSelectionEventRef` | ref | selection sync effect (before `diagram.select()`) | `handleChangedSelection` | Suppresses the echo `ChangedSelection` event GoJS fires synchronously during `diagram.select()`, which would otherwise set `skipsDiagramUpdate = true` and corrupt the next panel selection. |

`suppressNextSelectionEventRef` must be a ref, not state, because GoJS fires `ChangedSelection` synchronously inside the `diagram.select()` call, before the current effect returns. Any state update set before `diagram.select()` would not be visible in the handler's closure at that moment.

`skipsDiagramUpdate` must remain state because it is passed as a prop to `ReactDiagram`. A ref change does not trigger a re-render, so `ReactDiagram` would never see the updated value and would re-apply `nodeDataArray` into GoJS after every model mutation, causing duplicate nodes and links.

**The double-fire bug and why `skipsDiagramUpdate` is not a dependency of the selection effect**

The selection sync effect depends only on `selectedId`, not on `skipsDiagramUpdate`. If `skipsDiagramUpdate` were in the dependency array, removing it from the array would cause the effect to fire twice on every canvas click: once when `selectedId` changes (sees `skipsDiagramUpdate = true`, resets it, returns early), then again when `skipsDiagramUpdate` resets to `false` (now falls through to `diagram.select()` and `centerRect`). The biome exhaustive-deps rule is suppressed with an explanation at the call site.

### Node and link state: arrays in state, index maps as refs

`nodes` and `links` in `GraphEditor` are `AppNode[]` and `AppLink[]` arrays. Alongside them, two `useRef<Map<string, number>>` refs (`nodeIndexRef`, `linkIndexRef`) map each id to its position in the array.

**Why arrays in state, not `Map<string, T>`**

The initial implementation stored nodes and links as `Map<string, AppNode>` and `Map<string, AppLink>` in React state. GoJS and `NodeList` both need arrays, so every render that consumed the data ran `useMemo(() => [...nodes.values()], [nodes])` to convert — one spread per consumer per state change. With arrays in state, those conversions disappear entirely. The data is already in the shape every consumer needs.

**Why `useRef` for the index maps, not state or module-level variables**

Three options were considered:

| Option | Triggers re-render | Per-instance |
|---|---|---|
| `useState` | Yes | Yes |
| `useRef` | No | Yes |
| Module-level variable | No | No (shared across all instances) |

The index maps are a derived lookup cache, not source-of-truth data. Mutating them should not trigger re-renders. Module-level variables would be shared if `GraphEditor` were ever mounted more than once (tests, multi-panel layouts). `useRef` gives per-instance mutable storage that is invisible to React's render cycle.

**O(1) lookups**

Operations that previously needed `map.get(id)` now use `nodes[nodeIndexRef.current.get(id)]` — still O(1). For insertions, the index map is appended with the new item's position (`prev.length`) inside the state updater before returning the new array. For deletions (not yet implemented), a full index rebuild via `refreshNodeIndex`/`refreshLinkIndex` is in place.

### Single source of truth in React state, feedback-loop guard

React state (`nodes`, `links`, `selectedId`) is the single source of truth. GoJS is a controlled output — it receives data and reports events, but never owns state. This means:

- **No duplicated state.** The node list and the diagram canvas both read from the same `nodes` array in `GraphEditor`. There is no separate GoJS-side model that needs to be kept in sync manually.
- **Unidirectional data flow for selection.** When the user clicks a node on the canvas, GoJS fires `ChangedSelection`, which calls `onSelectionChange`, which calls `setSelectedId` in `GraphEditor`. React re-renders, passes the new `selectedId` down to both `NodeList` (highlights the row) and `DiagramWrapper` (selects the node in GoJS). The flow is always: GoJS event → React state → React render → GoJS update.

**Feedback-loop guard:** Without a guard, the selection sync creates an infinite loop. GoJS fires `ChangedSelection` → React sets `selectedId` → the `selectedId` effect runs → GoJS selects the node → GoJS fires `ChangedSelection` again → repeat. The guard is a single `isUpdatingFromDiagram` ref. The `ChangedSelection` handler sets it to `true` before calling `onSelectionChange` and back to `false` after. The `selectedId` effect checks it at the top and returns early if set, breaking the cycle.

**Name edit sync: O(1) via `NamePatch`**

Typing in the name field calls `handleNameChange(id, name)` which does two things in parallel:

1. Updates the `nodes` array in React state (so `NodeList` reflects the new name instantly).
2. Sets a `namePatch: { id, name }` state (a lightweight object carrying just the changed key and value).

`DiagramCanvas` has a dedicated effect on `namePatch` that calls `diagram.model.setDataProperty(nodeData, "name", namePatch.name)` — a single O(1) hash lookup into the GoJS model. Only the affected node re-renders in GoJS. The rest of the diagram is untouched.

This avoids the naive alternative of replacing the entire `nodeDataArray` on every keystroke, which would cause GoJS to tear down and rebuild all node visuals.

**Investigation: blocking ReactDiagram's `shouldComponentUpdate` during name patches**

An attempt was made to add `skipsDiagramUpdate || namePatch !== null` when passing `skipsDiagramUpdate` to `ReactDiagram`, reasoning that if a targeted patch was already handling the GoJS update, the full `mergeData` path via `shouldComponentUpdate` could be skipped. This was rejected for two reasons:

1. `namePatch !== null` is too broad — it would block ReactDiagram from updating for any reason while a patch is pending, including legitimate unrelated changes.
2. `ReactDiagram.shouldComponentUpdate` already guards against redundant syncs by comparing `nodeDataArray` and `linkDataArray` by reference. The `mergeData` call that follows is fast when GoJS's internal model already reflects the change from the targeted patch. React DevTools profiling confirmed no unnecessary re-renders were occurring without the extra guard.

Separately, clearing `namePatch` to `null` after each effect (via `setNamePatch(null)`) was also tried and rejected. It caused the namePatch effect to fire a second time with `null` as the value — an extra render and effect call with no benefit since the effect already guards with `if (!namePatch) return`.

**Selection deferral: `startTransition` on canvas-driven selection**

When the user clicks a node in the GoJS canvas, `handleChangedSelection` wraps `setSelectedId` in `startTransition`. The canvas selection highlight is handled by GoJS itself synchronously. The `selectedId` state update, which triggers `NodeList` to re-render and highlight the corresponding row, is lower priority and can be deferred. This keeps the canvas interaction feeling immediate even while 1000 list rows reconcile in the background.

## Testing Approach

### Stack and configuration

| Concern | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Runner | Jest 30 + ts-jest | Hard project requirement (NFR-7); Vitest and `bun test` are explicitly excluded |
| Config file | `jest.config.cjs` (`.cjs` extension) | `"type": "module"` in `package.json` makes Node treat `.js` as ESM; the CommonJS extension avoids a parse error |
| TS config | `tsconfig.test.json` | Separate file with `module: "CommonJS"` and `moduleResolution: "node"`. The app tsconfig uses `moduleResolution: "bundler"` which is Vite-specific and breaks ts-jest |
| Canvas | `jest-canvas-mock` | GoJS uses `<canvas>` internally; jsdom provides no canvas implementation |
| DOM matchers | `@testing-library/jest-dom` | Adds `toBeInTheDocument`, `toHaveValue`, etc. |
| Command | `bunx jest` / `bunx jest --coverage` | Use the `test:coverage` script from `package.json` for a full coverage report |

### Three layers of tests

**1. Pure unit tests**

These tests cover small, deterministic functions and component branches with mocks where needed.

- `src/utils/graphUtils.test.ts` exercises graph generation logic in isolation, including node counts, connectivity, and link uniqueness.
- `src/components/node-row/index.test.tsx` checks row rendering and selection clicks.
- `src/components/side-panel/index.test.tsx` verifies rendering states and name editing behavior with a real `useState` wrapper.
- `src/components/drawer/index.test.tsx` checks the responsive switch between the persistent and permanent drawer variants.
- `src/components/diagram-wrapper/index.test.tsx` covers the defensive listener branch when no GoJS diagram is available.

Key cases:

| File | Case |
|---|---|
| `graph-utils.test.ts` | 1 000-node graph has exactly 1 000 unique IDs |
| `graph-utils.test.ts` | All link endpoints reference valid node IDs |
| `graph-utils.test.ts` | No self-loops and no duplicate pairs in generated links |
| `graph-utils.test.ts` | BFS from `n0` reaches all nodes (graph is connected) |
| `graph-utils.test.ts` | `n=0` returns empty arrays without crashing |
| `node-row/index.test.tsx` | Click calls `onSelect` with the node ID and sets `selectedFromList` to `true` |
| `side-panel/index.test.tsx` | Shows placeholder when no node is selected or ID is absent from index |
| `side-panel/index.test.tsx` | Typing in the name field calls `setNamePatch` with the updated name |
| `side-panel/index.test.tsx` | Clearing the field calls `setNamePatch` with an empty string |

**2. DiagramCanvas unit tests**

`src/components/diagram-canvas/index.test.tsx` covers the sync logic around GoJS and React. The suite uses a scoped mock of `DiagramWrapper` for the branch-heavy cases so the tests can verify selection sync, loop suppression, and no-diagram guards without depending on full diagram initialization.

Key cases:

| Case |
|---|
| All provided nodes are rendered on load |
| `ClickCreatingTool` inserts a new node into the diagram |
| Self-loop link is rejected by the link validation rule |
| Duplicate link between already-connected nodes is rejected |
| Valid link between distinct, unconnected nodes is accepted |
| Adding a link via the model increments `diagram.links.count` |
| Does not crash when `selectedId` has no matching node in the diagram |
| Selecting a node from React calls `diagram.select` and `diagram.centerRect`, then suppresses the next `ChangedSelection` event to prevent a feedback loop |
| Selection and name-patch effects return early when no diagram is mounted |

**3. Integration test**

`src/app.integration.test.tsx` renders the full `<App />` and verifies the canvas and side panel working together. The test suite now uses a small mocked graph fixture instead of the full generated graph, which keeps the integration tests fast and stable in CI.

Key cases:

| Case |
|---|
| Mobile drawer opens from the trigger button and closes from the panel close button |
| Selecting a node on the canvas highlights its row in the NodeList |
| Adding a node on the canvas appends its row to the NodeList |
| Editing a node name in the properties panel updates the node label in the diagram |
| Drawing a link via `LinkingTool.insertLink()` syncs the new link into React state |

Key integration techniques:

- **GoJS instance access** — `go.Diagram.fromDiv()` retrieves the live diagram from the DOM.
- **Timer flushing** — `jest.useFakeTimers()` and `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()` let GoJS finish initialization before assertions run.
- **Tool API** — the tests drive GoJS behavior through the diagram tool APIs and `diagram.select(...)` instead of canvas pointer events, which jsdom cannot simulate reliably.
- **Responsive checks** — `window.matchMedia` is mocked so drawer behavior can be tested in mobile and desktop modes.

### Coverage results

```
Statements   : 98.43% (252/256)
Branches     : 87.50% (70/80)
Functions    : 98.00% (49/50)
Lines        : 98.74% (236/239)
```

**Remaining gaps and why they are acceptable:**

- `diagram-canvas` still has a handful of uncovered branches in the selection and model-sync guards. The lines are covered, but the defensive paths around `isAppNode`, `isAppLink`, `findNodeForKey`, and `nodeData` existence are not all taken in every case.
- `diagram-wrapper` still has uncovered listener-registration branches around the `instanceof go.Diagram` checks in mount and cleanup. The component is exercised, but the defensive false paths are not taken in the happy-path tests.
